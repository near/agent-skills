# SKILL: near-cli-rs — NEAR Protocol CLI Reference for AI Agents

**Purpose:** This file is for LLMs generating non-interactive `near` commands. When a user request maps to a CLI action, look up the correct syntax here, construct the complete one-liner, show it to the user for approval, then execute it.

**Rule:** Always produce complete commands from `near` through the final action token (`send`, `display`, `now`, `create`, etc.). Never omit `network-config <NETWORK>`.

**Version:** near-cli-rs v0.14+ (tested through v0.24)

---

## Command Grammar

```
near [GLOBAL_FLAGS] <COMMAND_GROUP> [ENTITY_ARGS] <SUBCOMMAND> [SUB_ARGS] network-config <NETWORK> [SIGNING_OPTION] [FINAL_ACTION]
```

- **View commands** end with: `now` | `at-block-height <N>` | `at-block-hash <HASH>`
- **Transaction commands** end with a signing option followed by `send` or `display`
- **Account creation via faucet** ends with `create`
- `network-config` keyword is **always required** (even for view commands)

---

## Global Flags

| Flag         | Effect                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--offline`  | Create/sign tx without network access                |
| `--quiet`    | Suppress progress output (recommended for scripting) |
| `--teach-me` | Print all RPC calls and their parameters             |

---

## Networks and View Qualifiers

| Item                  | Value                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Built-in networks     | `mainnet`, `testnet`                                        |
| Custom network        | any `<connection-name>` from `near config show-connections` |
| View: latest block    | `now`                                                       |
| View: specific height | `at-block-height <BLOCK_HEIGHT>`                            |
| View: specific hash   | `at-block-hash <BLOCK_HASH>`                                |

## Signing Options Reference

Replace `<SIGNING_OPTION>` in any transaction command with one of:

| Option                                   | Full syntax                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OS keychain (recommended)                | `sign-with-keychain send`                                                                                          |

| Ledger hardware wallet                   | `sign-with-ledger send`                                                                                            |
| Plaintext private key                    | `sign-with-plaintext-private-key --signer-public-key ed25519:<PUBKEY> --signer-private-key ed25519:<PRIVKEY> send` |
| Access key file                          | `sign-with-access-key-file /path/to/key.json send`                                                                 |
| Seed phrase                              | `sign-with-seed-phrase 'word1 ... word12' --seed-phrase-hd-path 'm/44'"'"'/397'"'"'/0'"'"'' send`                  |
| MPC                                      | `sign-with-mpc send`                                                                                               |
| Produce unsigned tx (sign later)         | `sign-later`                                                                                                       |

Replace `send` with `display` to print the signed transaction in base64 without broadcasting.

## Common Patterns (Cookbook)

Quick-reference one-liners for the most frequent tasks. Substitute placeholders with real values.

### 1. Check NEAR balance

```sh
near tokens alice.near view-near-balance network-config mainnet now
```

### 2. Transfer NEAR tokens

```sh
near tokens alice.near send-near bob.near '5 NEAR' network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 3. View account details

```sh
near account view-account-summary alice.near network-config mainnet now
```

### 4. List access keys

```sh
near account list-keys alice.near network-config mainnet now
```

### 5. Send fungible tokens

```sh
near tokens alice.near send-ft usdt.tether-token.near bob.near '10 USDT' memo '' network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 6. View FT balance

```sh
near tokens alice.near view-ft-balance usdt.tether-token.near network-config mainnet now
```

### 7. Call a view-only contract method

```sh
near contract call-function as-read-only wrap.near ft_balance_of json-args '{"account_id":"alice.near"}' network-config mainnet now
```

### 8. Call a state-changing contract method

```sh
near contract call-function as-transaction wrap.near ft_transfer json-args '{"receiver_id":"bob.near","amount":"1000000000000000000000000"}' prepaid-gas '100 Tgas' attached-deposit '1 yoctoNEAR' sign-as alice.near network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 9. Stake NEAR with a validator

```sh
near staking delegation alice.near deposit-and-stake '10 NEAR' aurora.pool.near network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 10. Unstake from a validator

```sh
near staking delegation alice.near unstake-all aurora.pool.near network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 11. Withdraw unstaked NEAR (after ~2 epoch wait)

```sh
near staking delegation alice.near withdraw-all aurora.pool.near network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 12. Create a testnet account (faucet-funded)

```sh
near account create-account sponsor-by-faucet-service myaccount.testnet autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain network-config testnet create
```

### 13. Create a sub-account (self-funded)

```sh
near account create-account fund-myself sub.alice.testnet '1 NEAR' autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-keychain sign-as alice.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 14. Deploy a contract

```sh
near contract deploy mycontract.testnet use-file ./contract.wasm without-init-call network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 15. Delete an access key

```sh
near account delete-keys alice.testnet public-keys ed25519:<PUBKEY_TO_REMOVE> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

### 16. Add a full-access key

```sh
near account add-key alice.testnet grant-full-access use-manually-provided-public-key ed25519:<NEW_PUBKEY> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

---

## Offline Mode and Scripting Tips

### Offline signing workflow (air-gapped / two-machine)

```sh
# Machine A (offline): produce signed tx in base64 without broadcasting
near --offline tokens alice.near send-near bob.near '1 NEAR' network-config mainnet sign-with-seed-phrase '<SEED_PHRASE>' --seed-phrase-hd-path 'm/44'"'"'/397'"'"'/0'"'"'' display

# Machine B (online): broadcast the base64 tx
near transaction send-signed-transaction '<SIGNED_TX_BASE64>' network-config mainnet
```

### sign-later workflow

```sh
# Step 1: produce unsigned base64 tx
near tokens alice.near send-near bob.near '1 NEAR' network-config mainnet sign-later

# Step 2: sign it (outputs signed base64)
near transaction sign-transaction '<UNSIGNED_TX_BASE64>' network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain display

# Step 3: broadcast
near transaction send-signed-transaction '<SIGNED_TX_BASE64>' network-config mainnet
```

### Scripting tips

- Always add `--quiet` to suppress progress output in scripts
- Always quote amounts: `'1 NEAR'`, `'0.5 NEAR'`, `'1 yoctoNEAR'`
- Seed phrase HD path shell escaping: `'m/44'"'"'/397'"'"'/0'"'"''`
- Use `display` instead of `send` to inspect signed tx before broadcasting

## Key Format Reference

| Item             | Format                       | Example                         |

| Private key      | `ed25519:<BASE58>`           | `ed25519:2qM8v3N...`            |
| Transaction hash | 44-char base58               | `F3eZmht...`                    |
| Named account    | `name.near` / `name.testnet` | `alice.near`                    |

## Common Errors

| Error                      | Likely cause / fix                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Account does not exist"   | Wrong network, or account not yet funded                   |
| "Access key not found"     | Use `sign-with-legacy-keychain` or `sign-with-seed-phrase` |
| "Exceeded prepaid gas"     | Increase gas: `'300 Tgas'`                                 |
